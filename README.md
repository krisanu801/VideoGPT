# VideoGPT
GPT works only on images . well here is the video version . feel free to upload any length of video. 
even it surprises me that it can process a full 1.5 hr length ml lecture video by Andrew Ng and generate notes and answer your prompts. 
In only just 2 minutes . isn't it fascinating.
whereas GPT4o promised us they will be able to answer video prompts.

and also github isn't allowing me to upload the main file so i am uploading some instances .
